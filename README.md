# Pontypool (2008) - Subtitles `PT-BR`

Portuguese (Brazilian) captions to one of the greatest horror pieces ever filmed.

Subtitles made with the aid of [**Subtitle Edit**](https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit).

## Notes from the translator

Maybe I should write these notes in Portuguese - but for now, it'll be in English.

I am truly passionate about this piece and I consider great responsibility to translate it properly - something that honestly I didn't feel was accomplished by trying PT-BR subs available around. Frankly, I don't need them, but being Brazilian and all and wanting to share this movie with everybody else that don't really speak English... You know. Troublesome. So I decided to give it my own shot.

In all honesty, I'm no professional translator - neither have I great experience with writing and syncing subtitles - but I *am* a professional coder, so I decided to host these subtitles on GitHub, so one can track all my corrections and, most importantly, I can leave these notes to whomever comes across these subs. Sadly I thought about hosting them on GitHub only after I had almost lost all my work (3 full days of hard work and still adjusting)... I really wish I had logged all my progress to share how the sausage is made.

Okay, we all know what it means to translate. It's more of an art, rather than just swapping words and expressions from one language to another. It takes quite a lot of holding your own with a language, but it also takes decision-making, rolling with the punches and making do with spoons when there are no spades around. It takes another human, another whole world and it's virtually impossible to make the whole experience identical to the original. (***Puns** are an excellent but painful example of things that can't be translated*). I spent great effort to make this work as seamlessly as possible so as not to ruin the experience for you.

If anything, thank you for reading these. I know how tl;dr these are.

## Difficult bits - `WARNING:` *spoilers ahead*

Now, as you'd expect, there were some remarkable bits that were just not easy to translate, so I'm gonna list them all below and provide an explanation on how I solved them:

### Metalanguage

If a hypothetical character said:

> I'm speaking plain English. 

Will I still call it "English" when translating to Portuguese? Because, then, I'd be speaking (actually "writing") Portuguese, right?

Most **dubs** I heard in Portuguese just start calling the language itself "Portuguese", because there's literally no English coming out of the TV. But with **subs** it's evident that the characters are speaking English and the Portuguese subs are just helping you understand just that. So it's okay to keep calling it "English", and that's what I did.

> `00:41:20.823` For greater safety, please avoid... the **English language**.

... became *favor evitar a **língua inglesa*** (languages and peoples are not capitalized in Portuguese).

> `01:12:28.200` ... It's only the **English language** that's infected!

... became *é só a **língua inglesa** que está infectada!*

I'm guessing this might be a hot topic among translators around the world, but since I never read or talked about it, I thought it would be worth giving it a footnote.

### [`take no prisoners`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/take_no_prisoners)

This was by far the hardest one.

Roughly means acting relentlessly and often ruthlessly in the pursuit of something, not caring about how people feel or what the consequences of one's actions are or will be. No such an expression in Portuguese (that I know of).

In one translation I checked (which pissed me off enough to write my own) it was translated as *"não fazer reféns"* and then *"não fazer prisioneiros"*, which is literally "not to take hostages" and "not to take prisoners", respectively. Ugh.

We do, however, have one expression that means "talking without mincing one's own words", to speak one's mind in an uncompromising way: **sem papas na língua** (adjective) and **ter papas na língua** (verb - I preferred using "ficar de..." which just sounds better), which I reckoned was quite appropriate to that particular context, but not without side-effects:

> `00:54:48.200` We're holding our own here, today and we are taking no prisoners, friends.
> `00:54:54.000` However, today we *are* those prisoners. We are tired... and we are scared.

I had to come up with something that actually placed the "however" in the "taking no prisoners" thing, something that overturned what he just said. So I just did "Porém, **estamos restritos**, hoje." ("we are restrained"), which would kind of imply that "you can say whatever you want, but can't do whatever"...

And then, near the end:

> `01:27:30.000` Hello, Pontypool. This is Grant Mazzy, here, and today we are taking no prisoners.
> `01:27:35.000` 'Cause in fact today, folks, we set those prisoners free.

Lucky thing **língua** means both "language" and "tongue" (the organ). The illness in this movie affects the English language itself, so I thought *libertaremos nossa língua* ("break our language free") would work.
