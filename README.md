# [Pontypool (2008)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pontypool) - Subtitles `PT-BR`

Portuguese (Brazilian) captions to one of the greatest horror pieces ever filmed.

Subtitles made with the aid of [**Subtitle Edit**](https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit).

## Notes from the translator

Maybe I should write these notes in Portuguese - but for now, it'll be in English.

I am truly passionate about this piece and I consider great responsibility to translate it properly - something that honestly I didn't feel was accomplished by trying PT-BR subs available around. Frankly, I don't need them, but being Brazilian and all and wanting to share this movie with everybody else that don't really speak English... You know. Troublesome. So I decided to give it my own shot.

In all honesty, I'm no professional translator - neither have I great experience with writing and syncing subtitles - but I *am* a professional coder, so I decided to host these subtitles on GitHub, so one can track all my corrections and, most importantly, I can leave these notes to whomever comes across these subs. Sadly I thought about hosting them on GitHub only after I had almost lost all my work (3 full days of hard work and still adjusting)... I really wish I had logged all my progress to share how the sausage is made.

Okay, we all know what it means to translate. It's more of an art, rather than just swapping words and expressions from one language to another. It takes quite a lot of holding one's own with a language, but it also takes decision-making, rolling with the punches, making do with spoons when there are no spades around and ultimately imprinting the text with oneself. It takes another human, another whole world and it's virtually impossible to make the whole experience identical to the original. (***Puns** and **wordplay** are an excellent but painful example of things that can't be translated*). I spent great effort to make this work as seamlessly as possible so as not to ruin the experience for you.

If anything, thank you for reading these. I know how tl;dr these are.

## Difficult bits - `WARNING: SPOILERS`

Now, as you'd expect, there were some remarkable bits that were just not easy to translate, so I'm gonna list them all below and provide an explanation on how I solved them:

### Metalanguage

If a hypothetical character said:

> I'm speaking plain English. 

Will I still call it "English" when translating to Portuguese? Because, then, I'd be speaking (actually "writing") Portuguese, right?

Most **dubs** I heard in Portuguese just start calling the language itself "Portuguese", because there's literally no English coming out of the TV. But with **subs** it's evident that the characters are speaking English and the Portuguese subs are just helping you understand just that. So it's okay to keep calling it "English", and that's what I did.

> `00:41:20.823` For greater safety, please avoid... the **English language**.

... became *favor evitar a **língua inglesa*** (languages and peoples are not capitalized in Portuguese).

> `01:12:28.200` ... It's only the **English language** that's infected!

... became *é só a **língua inglesa** que está infectada!*

I'm guessing this might be a hot topic among translators around the world, but since I never read or talked about it, I thought it would be worth giving it a footnote.

### Phonetic resemblance

When the infected are on the first stages of the infection, the first symptom is to start confusing and swapping words with ones that just sound similar.

It'd be a bit troublesome to fit them into the context, so I left them with them translated with no adaptations - I didn't go far to make the mixed up words sound very similar - in the hopes that whoever's watching will notice that, in the spoken English, the words actually sound alike.

### [`take no prisoners`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/take_no_prisoners)

This was by far the hardest one.

Roughly means acting relentlessly and often ruthlessly in the pursuit of something, not caring about how people feel or what the consequences of one's actions are or will be. No such an expression in Portuguese (that I know of).

In one translation I checked (which pissed me off enough to write my own) it was translated as *"não fazer reféns"* and then *"não fazer prisioneiros"*, which is literally "not to take hostages" and "not to take prisoners", respectively. Ugh.

We do, however, have one expression that means "talking without mincing one's own words", to speak one's mind in an uncompromising way: **sem papas na língua** (adjective) and **ter papas na língua** (verb - I preferred using "ficar de..." which just sounds better), which I reckoned was quite appropriate to that particular context, but not without side-effects:

> `00:54:48.200` We're holding our own here, today and we are taking no prisoners, friends.
> `00:54:54.000` However, today we *are* those prisoners. We are tired... and we are scared.

I had to come up with something that actually placed the "however" in the "taking no prisoners" thing, something that overturned what he just said. So I just did "Porém, **estamos restritos**, hoje." ("we are restrained"), which would kind of imply that "you can say whatever you want, but can't do whatever"...

And then, near the end:

> `01:27:30.000` Hello, Pontypool. This is Grant Mazzy, here, and today we are taking no prisoners.
> `01:27:35.000` 'Cause in fact today, folks, we set those prisoners free.

Lucky thing **língua** means both "language" and "tongue" (the organ). The illness in this movie affects the English language itself, so I thought *libertaremos nossa língua* ("break our language free") would work.

### `kill`, `killers`, `killing`

> `01:22:13.700` You're gonna have killers in here soon if you keep killing your own rules, Grant.

Why, the obvious translation would be:

> terá assassinos aqui, em breve, se continuar matando suas próprias regras, Grant.

"Assassino" is not the same as "assassin". We do use it in the sense of "killer for hire", but more often than not, it means just "murderer".
Later on:

> `01:22:56.900` You'd have to kill... all the killing...
> [...]
> `01:23:06.000` So how do you make it unrecognizable? How... and what word?
> `01:23:14.900` ... *Kill*...

We find out that the only reason she started the "kill" sentences was because the word was infected.

"Kill" becomes "matar". "Assassinar" would be extremely awkward and unnatural.

So back to the "you're gonna have killers in here soon" bit. Since "assassinos" is out of the question, we should obviously stick to "matador", right? Except we never ever say "matador". Then how the hell do I blend "matar" into the context?

I went with "cair matando", which translates to, I believe, "go all out".

### `loop`

This one wasn't actually difficult, just something that others might have done differently.

> `01:11:15.100` I've looped it.

Theoretically you *could* translate it as "coloquei para repetir" ("I set it to repeat itself") or "coloquei em repetição" ("I set it into repetition"), because "repetição" is the closest we have to "loop" in Portuguese - in fact, that's the politically correct way people call a "loop" in programming while in college.

However the truth is that we don't *ever* call it "repetição", except when specifically trying to be politically correct. Even on everyday language, younger PT-BR speakers would use the word "loop" as is (although some will annoyingly and stubbornly use "looping" instead of "loop"). In technical jargon, especially in the computing, musical and presumbly radio businesses, virtually everybody knows what a "loop" is. So no, I won't be calling it "repetição".
